# liev-server

If you meant to type "npx live-server", and accidentally typed `npx liev-server`, then this project will be downloaded. it will say "Boo!"

Then npx will delete the files it downloaded, and you will not know what else this program did on your computer besides say "boo."

WTF npx

how is that even ok

Do not use npx. Or if you must, use `npx --no-install`
